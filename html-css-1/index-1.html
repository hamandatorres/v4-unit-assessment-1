    <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the first and latest major version og HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is manintained by a consortium of the major browser venders (Apple, google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
    <p>HMTL5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 january 2008, with a major update and "W3C" Recommendation status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the languag with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices scu has web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML/</p>

    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors and font. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repitition in the structural content. Separation and formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting f the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more thna one rule matched a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. </p>
    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide web consortium (W3C). internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for the use with CSS by RF 2318(March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, other markup languages suppor the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
